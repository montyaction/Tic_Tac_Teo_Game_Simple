# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The game features a 3x3 grid of cells and allows two players to take turns marking the cells with their respective symbols (X and O).

## Getting Started

To play the game, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. Click on any cell to mark it with your symbol. The game will automatically check for a winner after each move and display a message when the game is over. To start a new game, click the "New Game" button.
